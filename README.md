enter in the number and how many times you want it to spam (loops) ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f5af6dda-f7e8-4e0a-b428-4d62d61f6d78)
keep delay for number input at 1-10ms ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/aab34dbb-02e4-4bb3-a2fe-a0c319f47cf2)
wait time before actions is how much you want time you want it to wait before ending the call and recalling, for spam make it to 2.9-3secs which is my favorite
thats all!
